<p>Tombstone is a fantastic western in my option. It could have done without any romance subplot but overall it's great.</p>
<h3>Dune: Part 2 | 9/10</h3>

<p>I love this film from the set deigns to the music score. Christopher Walken wasn't the greatest casting choice but everyone was wonderful in their roles.</p>
<h3>Jobs | 7/10</h3>

<p>One of the best movies about Steve Jobs. Does it mean it's the best movie? No.</p>
